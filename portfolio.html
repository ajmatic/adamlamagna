					This is my musical website. It took me a really long time to get two fixed sidebars on opposite sides of each other. I have some of my original tunes on here and a few covers. Check it out when you get a moment. I'm doing a lot of acoustic-electronica music. 
				</p><br>
				
				<li><a href="http://www.thegreenleaf.me">The Green Leaf</a></li>
				<p>
					This was my very first website I coded over the summer. It took me about a month and I never really finished it, but it was before I knew hardly anything about coding.
				</p><br>

				<li><a href="#">ThatGirlJulia</a></li>
				<p>
					A WordPress site coming soon!
				</p>
				<h2>Cool stuff I've been learning</h2><br><br>

				<li><a href="../trollslayer/index.html">Walking through the woods</a></li>
				<p>
					This is my very first 'choose your own adventure' game and it is written in JavaScript. It's really goofy, but it actually took me awhile to figure out, so don't laugh!!
				</p><br>

				<li><a href="games/roshambo.html">RoShamBo</a></li>
				<p>
					Play a rock, paper, scissors game against the computer. Also written in JavaScript, play as many times as you like!
				</p><br>
				<li><a href="me_learn_code/index.html">To-Do List</a></li>
				<p>
					Here is a handy page for all those people who like to make lists (I'm one of those people)! So, if you need to make your daily to-do list or a grocery list, use this tool I coded with jQuery.
				</p><br>
				<li><a href="me_learn_code/responsive.html">Being Responsive</a></li>
				<p>
					This is simply a page to show you how responsive design works. Because there are so many different devices from pc's to iphones, coders are designing more fluid layouts that work across all platforms. 
				</p><br>
				<li><a href="me_learn_code/color.html">Changing Background Colors</a></li>
				<p>
					This was pretty easy, but it's still fun to be able to show this to other people. Click a button - change the color of your page!!
				</p><br>
				<li><a href="me_learn_code/daily.html">The Daily Clock</a></li>
				<p>
					It's no secret that computers can tell time, but that code has to be written into the computer. Check out this page if you want to know exactly what time it is!
