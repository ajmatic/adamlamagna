            <p>
              On the Job Training and Paid Internships provide an opportunity for employers to be reimbursed for training a new employee that can meet your specific needs before making a permanent job offer. While in the program the employer will work with a State of CT Bureau of Rehabilitation Services (BRS) representative to develop a training plan and provide assistance with recommendations and resources. BRS will pay for the employer's training expense and ensure that the new employee has supports, if needed.
