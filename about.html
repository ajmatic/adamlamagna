				Each morning he'd stack up the letters he'd write....tomorrow. And think of the friends he'd fill with delight....tomorrow. It was too bad, indeed; he was busy today and hadn't a minute to stop on his way. "More time I'll give to others," he'd say....tomorrow. But the fact is he died and faded from view and all that was left when the living was through was a mountain of things he intended to do....tomorrow.

				I don't want to be that guy!! I want to do the things I need to in order to get where I want to be. So many people wake up each morning and tell themselves that they are going to change. That this is the day I start making my life better. But to most, all it is, is a line. And a way to make that person feel better about their lives.

				I've done construction and sales jobs most of my life, but those jobs never made me jump out of bed in the morning. And I have to remember that there was a time in my life when I didn't know how to do either. It took me awhile to become a knowledgeable salesman. It took me years to become a tradesman and if I was at either of those jobs I know I'd still be learning.

				So, I'm off on this new adventure of coding websites and learning as much as I can about web development. I actually really enjoy it, it's fun! And it makes me want to get up in the morning.
