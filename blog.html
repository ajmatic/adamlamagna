				This is going to be a little rant because I've been using WordPress for about the last two weeks and it's still totally confusing to me. It's easier for me to code a website from scratch than to use this COntent Management System.

				I had a great day today, met some incredible people and I'm taking action towards starting my new life. I can't express how great it feels to be doing something different and meeting new people. I'm going to start joining some JavaScript meet-ups too!! But for those of you who are interested in User Experience and User Interface check out this cool company - <a href="https://www.uie.com/">UIE</a> - they are experts in the field of UX/UI. I'm also reading a book by Steve Krug called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Make_Me_Think">Don't Make Me Think</a> and it's all about the human-computer interaction. It's really quite fascinating. So, take the time to do a little research on these subjects, I'm going to do the same. I'll have more for you in the upcoming weeks!!! Happy Holiday Season!!

				I put up a few more items in my portfolio, I'm learning some pretty cool stuff and I have also started building a WordPress site for a friend of mine, so we'll see how that goes. But there is so much you can do with having just a little knowledge of a program language. Today I made a to-do page, you can enter an item you want into it and it saves it on the page for you. It's almost like a digital grocery list. You can check it out <a href="../me_learn_code/todo">here</a>. I also put up a page that is a fluid design, it's what they call in the industry responsive. There are so many different types and size devices, so programmers are now building and designing sites that can be accessed across any platform, be it a laptop or an iPad. You can check that page out <a href="../me_learn_code/responsive">here</a>. And all my code is available to see on <a href="https://github.com/ajmatic">my GitHub page</a>. So, check these things out and set yourself up with a GitHub account if you haven't already!t

				Ok, I'm finally getting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, it's about time! I actually really like it now that I understand it. It's hard for someone who has zero knowledge of the programming world to really grasp what the concept of programming is. It's really a way to manipulate data and to make that data work for you in a certain environment. JavaScript is cool! Ok, that's my post for today!

				Ok, I want to get everyone reading this setup to start making webpages. I am learning Wordpress. There is a difference between <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> and 
				<a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>. Basically, the difference is that WP.com is for those who don't want to worry about hosting your blog and just worry about the content. WP.org is where you can download WP onto your computer and do everything else yourself, like web hosting, etc. To really know the difference, check out this <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/">link</a>. WordPress is a beast within itself, there is so much to learn about it. If you want to start a quick blog, just go to <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WP.com</a> and get started. But if you want to design a site from scratch, read on....
			</p><br>
			<p>
				I'm going to give you a number of sites to use as resources as we go along. You really need to download a text editor to write code. You can download <a href="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a>, or <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.5.1.html">Notepad</a>, <a href="https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">gedit</a> may already be installed on your computer. I use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime</a>. You can use which ever one you want, I like Sublime, but I have also heard really good things about Aptana. Your choice! Once you've done that, you may begin.
			</p><br>
			<p>
				Document types need to be setup properly, I suggest going <a href="http://www.sencha.com/learn/html-page-setup/">here</a> to learn more about that and I want you guys to start with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, this will help you get familiar with coding. Set up an account with Codecademy and start doing the first couple of lessons, trust me, you'll like it!!

				I've got my music site up, you can check out <a id="aj" href="http://www.ajmatic.com">AJ Matic</a>. It  took me a long time to figure out how to get two fixed sidebars, the only problem is that it's not mobile-responsive. I'm gonna have to go back and refactor some of my code. But what I want to talk about is putting your code in a repository, just in case something happens, like your computer crashes or someone steals it. If you put your code in a repo, then you'll always have a virtual backup. I use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, but you can use a number of different ones, I also like <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>.  Creating a repo is relatively easy. Click <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo">here</a> to learn how. You have to be a little familiar with the command line in your terminal. For those of you who are Linux users, you may go <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/">here</a> to learn more about that. Once you get the hang of things, it's actually pretty cool. Mess around with the terminal, but whatever you do, don't ever type <code>rm -rf/</code> into the command line. That will remove your entire system, kapoot!! Blump!!! Gone...For...Good! Do <b>NOT</b> do that.

				Ok, so I have been going back over all the sites I'm in the process of coding and I've been retro-fitting it to be semantic and mobile-responsive. Now, it's not actually called retro-fitting in the web world, that's just a term from my construction days. It's called refactoring your code. So, that's what I did all day, refactored. And it's really quite a pain to do, so first lesson to be learned is - D.R.Y - you will see this over and over again in programming. <b>D</b>o <b>N</b>ot <b>R</b>epeat yourself! What I really mean is when you have several pages that are linked to your home (index) page, you don't want to keep repeating yourself if those linked pages will have some if not most of the properties of your index page. I'm going to explain a little more about this tomorrow and we will get you set up with everything you need to know to start building your own website.

				I've been living in Boston (Dorchester, actually) for about 5 months and it's okay. I don't think I'm a big city guy anymore. I like the smaller big cities, like Providence. It's big enough, so there's plenty to do, but it's small enough, so people are nice to each other. I lived in L.A. for about 7 years and I loved it when I was 22, but I like my smaller towns. I like the quiet, and I like things not being so busy all the time.   
			</p><br>
			<p>
				Anyways, on to some other things! Coding, coding is pretty radical! It's amazing the things you can do. If you know how to code and can do it well, you can do anything you want. Like create an app that helps people locate good restaurants in their area, or code a website that helps you keep track of the important things you need to do on a particular day. These ideas are obviously already taken, but you can come up with any new idea and you can always improve on the ideas that are already out there. 
			</p><br>

				So, I've been learning some pretty neat stuff. HTML and CSS laid the ground work for me. You must learn these two things first. HTML is the bones or skeleton of your website. It's a document where you put all of your text and headers, paragraphs and sidebars, and much more. It's essential to creating a website. CSS lets you decorate that website. You can make your header look like block lettering or make your navigation list change color when the mouse hovers over it. I have just recently begun JavaScript and jQuery, and these two things let the user of your website interact with it. It can animate something or make an image explode. It's pretty cool!
