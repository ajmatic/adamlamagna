				Ok, so I have been going back over all the sites I'm in the process of coding and I've been retro-fitting it to be semantic and mobile-responsive. Now, it's not actually called retro-fitting in the web world, that's just a term from my construction days. It's called refactoring your code. So, that's what I did all day, refactored. And it's really quite a pain to do, so first lesson to be learned is - D.R.Y - you will see this over and over again in programming. <b>D</b>o <b>N</b>ot <b>R</b>epeat yourself! What I really mean is when you have several pages that are linked to your home (index) page, you don't want to keep repeating yourself if those linked pages will have some if not most of the properties of your index page. I'm going to explain a little more about this tomorrow and we will get you set up with everything you need to know to start building your own website.

				I've been living in Boston (Dorchester, actually) for about 5 months and it's okay. I don't think I'm a big city guy anymore. I like the smaller big cities, like Providence. It's big enough, so there's plenty to do, but it's small enough, so people are nice to each other. I lived in L.A. for about 7 years and I loved it when I was 22, but I like my smaller towns. I like the quiet, and I like things not being so busy all the time.

				Anyways, on to some other things! Coding, coding is pretty radical! It's amazing the things you can do. If you know how to code and can do it well, you can do anything you want. Like create an app that helps people locate good restaurants in their area, or code a website that helps you keep track of the important things you need to do on a particular day. These ideas are obviously already taken, but you can come up with any new idea and you can always improve on the ideas that are already out there.

				So, I've been learning some pretty neat stuff. HTML and CSS laid the ground work for me. You must learn these two things first. HTML is the bones or skeleton of your website. It's a document where you put all of your text and headers, paragraphs and sidebars, and much more. It's essential to creating a website. CSS lets you decorate that website. You can make your header look like block lettering or make your navigation list change color when the mouse hovers over it. I have just recently begun JavaScript and jQuery, and these two things let the user of your website interact with it. It can animate something or make an image explode. It's pretty cool!
