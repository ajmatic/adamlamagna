			<h1>Hello, Everyone!!</h1>
			<p>
				I've been reading so many books, watching a lot of tutorials, and doing interactive coding classes online. I've been at it since this summer (summer of 2013) and I want to put my knowledge to the test so I can get my name out there. The skills I've been learning will no doubt help me get to where I want to be, but I've still got a long way to go. HTML and CSS came somewhat easy to me, it's actually quite straight forward - Element names are usually what they mean, declarations explain what their purpose is. Then I moved on to JavaScript and that totally confused the coding right out of me!

			<p>
				So, I'm walking the Code Road, at least that's what I call it. I want to be a coder, and I know there's so much to learn that I can't be great at everything. And from my understanding, a jack-of-all-trades doesn't really make it in this business. Pick one thing you like and know it, period! I guess I'm having a little trouble picking that one thing. JavaScript is crazy confusing, I'm liking what I know of Python so far, and I have yet to try any PHP. 
			</p><br>
			<p>
				This will be my experimenting website, I'm going to put up all the things I'm learning and exactly which ones I like the best. Then I'm going to hone in on one skillset and become great at it. So here it is, all my code laid out for all to see. I'm trying to be semantic and at the same time responsive because we all know that is the direction websites are going, if not already there! I'm going to try to put up something new each day and teach what I'm learning. Crawl before I walk, though, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Enjoy!
